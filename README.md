## Features

- Easy server setup
- Good filter system to catch bypasses as they come.
- A blacklist to stop people from sending 𝕤𝕡𝕖𝕔𝕚𝕒𝕝 characters
- Nickname monitoring system which will revert it back to what it was previously and alert the staff
- Mod pings for detected slurs and automatic 12 hour timeout.
- Have people found a bypass that's now patched but the messages are still littered about? We have a command to clear through chats that deletes & reports messages found.

## Setup

Aftering adding the bot to your server here is a guide:

1. In the channel you'd like to recieve reports in (good example is a mod channel) run the command `/setchannel @staffping` to set the channel and recieve reports.
2. If someone bypasses the filter using 𝕤𝕡𝕖𝕔𝕚𝕒𝕝 characters run the command `/blacklist (userid)` to make them qwerty characters restricted!

## Questions

- Q: Will there be slash commands?
- A: Soon, with how the bot is made and me having no prior experience with slash commands it's rather tricky but I hope to get it done soonish

- Q: Who is this for?
- A: This is for small/medium servers with a slur problem and want a quick and easy solution
